        We wanted to update you on the progress with our new body corporate manager. Here's where things are at with the transition and what's happening next.

        Annual General Meeting

        We're pleased to let you know that everything needed to schedule the AGM is now in place. We're currently working through the scheduling process and expect the meeting to be held in mid-March.

        If you have any motions you'd like the committee to consider, please use the form on our website to submit them. This ensures your ideas can be properly reviewed and included on the agenda.

        Budget

        As part of preparing for the AGM, we've completed our budget review. The budget will be included with your AGM notice when it's sent out.

      <div class="pb-3 text-base/6 sm:text-sm/6 font-roboto text-black">
        This review is important because it allows us to plan and complete outstanding maintenance and improvement work across the complex.

        Levies

      <div class="pb-3 text-base/6 sm:text-sm/6 font-roboto text-black">
        We know the December levies haven't been issued yet. During the committee transition period, we weren't able to process these as normal.
      </div>
      <div class="pb-3 text-base/6 sm:text-sm/6 font-roboto text-black">
        Once the AGM is held, we'll be in a position to issue the levy notices. You'll have plenty of time to pay them after they're sent out.
      </div>
      <div class="pb-3 text-base/6 sm:text-sm/6 font-roboto text-black">
        We're also looking at ways to better align the timing of levy notices, the AGM and the financial year end. This would make things simpler for everyone. We're not sure if this will be possible, but we'll try to make it happen if we can.
