        Hello Northmarque community
      </p>
      <p class="mb-1 text-base/6 sm:text-sm/6 font-roboto text-nmqgray-00">
        Welcome to the first edition of <span class="font-semibold">Northmarque news</span> for 2026.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-1 text-base/6 sm:text-sm/6 font-roboto text-nmqgray-00">
        As owners know, at the end of 2025 we had to transition from our previous Body Corporate Manager (Hartley's) to BC Systems. We also transitioned to our new Caretaking Service Contractor, Aspire Facility Services. Both change were significant and we acknowledge that there are still some issues to work through, however, we have made good progress already. There are more updates below.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-1 text-base/6 sm:text-sm/6 font-roboto text-nmqgray-00">
        We appreciate your patience and understanding during the transition period. If there are any specific matters, questions of concerns you would like to raise, please do not hesitate to contact us by email at <a href="mailto:community@northmarque.net">community@northmarque.net</a>.
