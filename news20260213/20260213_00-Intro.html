        Hello Northmarque community
      </p>
      <p class="mb-1 text-base/6 sm:text-sm/6 font-roboto text-nmqgrey-00">
        Welcome to the first edition of <span class="font-[500]">Northmarque news</span> for 2026.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-1 text-base/6 sm:text-sm/6 font-roboto text-nmqgrey-00">
        Owners would be aware that at the end of 2025 we had to transition from our previous Body Corporate Manager (Hartley's) to BC Systems. We also transitioned to our new Caretaking Service Contractor, Aspire Facility Services. Both of these were significant changes.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-1 text-base/6 sm:text-sm/6 font-roboto text-nmqgrey-00">
        Since mid-January when BC Systems returned to work post-Christmas, we have been working closely with them to ensure a smooth transition. We have been impressed with their professionalism and responsiveness. They have also conducted significant work to ensure that as our scheme was onboarded, any issues that were identified were resolved as quickly as possible. We are pleased with the progress that has been made so far.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-1 text-base/6 sm:text-sm/6 font-roboto text-nmqgrey-00">
        We do acknowledge that there are still some issues to work through, some of which impacted our ability to conduct business as usual, however, we have made good progress and the updates below outline the work that has been done and the work that is still underway.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-1 text-base/6 sm:text-sm/6 font-roboto text-nmqgrey-00">
        We have appreciated the community's support, patience and understanding during the transition period. If there are any specific matters, questions or concerns you would like to raise after reading the remainder of this newsletter, please do not hesitate to contact us by email at <a href="mailto:community@northmarque.net">community@northmarque.net</a>.
